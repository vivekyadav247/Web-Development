    <h1>Loops</h1>
    <h2>Qs1. Write a JS program to delete all occurrences of element ‘num’ in a given array.
        Example : if arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 2, 3] & num = 2
        Result should be arr = [1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 3]
    </h2>
    <h2>Qs2. Write a JS program to find the no of digits in a number.
        Example : if number = 287152, count = 6
    </h2>
    <h2>Qs3. Write a JS program to find the sum of digits in a number.
        Example : if number = 287152, sum = 25
    </h2>
    <h2>Qs4. Print the factorial of a number n.
        [Factorial of a number n is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to a
        given positive integer and denoted by that integer. ]
        Example :
        
        7! (factorial of 7) = 1x2x3x4x5x6x7 = 5040
        5! (factorial of 5) = 1x2x3x4x5 = 120
        3! (factorial of 3) = 1x2x3 = 6
        0! Is always 1
    </h2>
    <h2>Qs5. Find the largest number in an array with only positive numbers.</h2>
